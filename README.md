# The Pathfinder

## The objective:
The objective of the game is very simple. Find the path to the top by clicking the squares.

## The Rules:

- To start the game, find an arrow which marks the first correct square.
- Each correct square is touching one another either by a corner or a side - forming a path.
- Now, you must find the path to the top by correctly guessing the next square in the row above.
- The correct squares will change color to GREEN,  while incorrect squares will flash RED.
- ... one more thing
- Every time you click the incorrect square, the path will reset, so I hope you are lucky and have outstanding memory.

Enjoy and may luck be ever in your favor!
